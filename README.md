# Back Story

#### You probably don't want to read it
This web app was designed and developed by me and was launched officially in 2016.

I started this venture after seeing my dad facing a lot of trouble with costly accounting software and also cause GST was going to be introduced in India and I thought that it's the perfect time to enter the market. 

Though I underestimated the market validation and I again did a crash landing, everything was great about it, the product was beautiful, the problem was there too but my solution to solve it was quite different so I should have done a market validation for to check the validity of my solution. But I am happy that I learned a lot from it, **I fail fast to learn fast**.

#### What's in it for you
If you are looking for a free accounting software or foundation for it then you should check it out.
